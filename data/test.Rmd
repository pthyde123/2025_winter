## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Winter 2024 seedlots
#### Seelots are created in T3 by transfering 'Grain Weight g' plot data to seed lots 
#### Create seedlots from a Trial
###### Trial can be specific managament factor subset of a trial (doesn't seem to work, freezes up)
###### Can use accession, plot, or sublot
######{accession_name}-{trial_name}-plot_number

Enter a template for naming each new seedlot. The following variables (surrounded by curly braces) can be used in the template and the value of that variable will be replaced.

trial_name
accession_name
plot_name
plot_number
rep
block
index - an incrementing index number, starting with 1

### {accession_name}-{trial_name}-plot_number
This format work well, it is best to have the plot number identified so that the harvest bag can be easily located.
